# Solutions
You can find the solutions by going to the `solution` branch. 

On GitHub, go to the upper-left where there is a dropdown which says "![branch symbol](./branch-symbol.svg) main" and change that to "solution."

On your computer, first make sure your own changes are committed (run `git add .` and `git commit`) and then run `git pull` and `git switch solution`. You can switch back and forth between the default `main` branch and the `solution` branch using `git switch`.
